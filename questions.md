1. Think about arrays
- What are some of the methods (non-iterator methods) that you know?
- When are they used?

2. Now list iterator methods for arrays
- There are four main ones that we have discussed
- When do you use each one

3. Now onto objects
  1. Why do we even have objects?  Why not just use hashes?
  2. What is the difference between using a getter method, and just referencing the instance variable?
  3. Should a method that finds the correct user by name (eg. find_by_name?) be a class method or instance method?  Why?
  4. How does initialize work in an object?
  5. What two methods will attr_accessor :name write?
  Write them out please...

4. Object Relations
  Consider books, authors and genres.
  1. Draw out the relations between the objects.  Assume a book can only have one genre.
  2. Which object is going act as my join - and thus store the data?
  3. Ok, now write out the three classes and fill in the belongs to relations.
  4. Now write the method that will give me a list of books written by an author.
  5. Now write a method that will give a list of all of the genre's of an author.
